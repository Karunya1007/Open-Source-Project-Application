#### Why You?
I think I am best suitable for this because I am very eager to learn new things and started to like reading large codes. Also once if I starting liking anything I will give my all to it until it succeeded.

#### What inspires you to be a PM on the MPL Open Source Project in The Programming Club? What are your various commitments for the upcoming year? How do you plan to manage your time between them?
I am very interested to start my journey in Open Source so I think being a PM in MPL Project gives me experience. I believe this as a very good oppurtunity to excel at solving real world problems, I am a Guild member of Mathematics Club. I think on an average I can give both of them 1-1:30 hr per day. I think I can manage time between them because I like being part of both.
